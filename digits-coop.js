// The digit grid as a shared board (docs/coop.md): what Sudoku, Calcudoku and Kakuro share, as digits-edit.js is what they
// share on the page. Pure (no page), so tests can check it and a phone can load an adapter from any page.
//
// A set of entries (digits-edit.js: `v` a value a cell, 0 when empty; `n` a mask a cell, bit d for a pencil mark of digit d) is
// the board's layers, one string each and a character a cell, so two partners writing in different cells, or marking different
// digits in one cell, never meet:
//   v     the digit in the cell, 0 for empty, as one character in base 36 (a grid has at most 12 digits)
//   n1…nK a layer for each digit d, "1" where the cell has a pencil mark for d
// The pencil marks are shared too: it is one board, and what a partner has marked in a cell they are looking at is worth
// seeing. A mark and a digit are in different layers, so a mark can never overwrite a digit; a cell with a digit shows no
// marks (digits.js), and rubbing the digit out brings them back, as they do solo. Undo and redo are each player's own history
// (digits-edit.js's moves) sent as edits: an undo is weak, so it only puts back what it finds as it left it.
