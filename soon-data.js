// The games on the games screen that aren't built yet (31 October 2026, Korbi: "Bridges, masyu, nurikabe, slitherlink,
// rack, go, pegs, meld, French tarot… the rest just get a tile placeholder with todo for now"). Each has a tile, and the tile
// opens soon.html, which says what the game will be and what's left to do. `id`, `name` and `sec` are the tile's (apps.js);
// `line` is the game in a sentence, `todo` what building it takes and where the risk is. A game that gets built loses its entry
// here and its tile points at its own page; tests/soon.mjs fails while a tile and its entry disagree.
