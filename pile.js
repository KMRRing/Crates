// The pile: what you didn't know, brought back until you do. Every knowledge game records an item when you miss
// it, pass on it, or barely stake on it, and when it comes back and you get it right it moves up a pile; wrong,
// and it drops to the first. Six piles with growing gaps, Leitner's boxes on Pimsleur's clock: ultra-short
// (due at once, for the next block), short (ten minutes), medium (twelve hours), long (a week), longer (a month),
// longest (three months); right in the longest pile and it's learned. Chess puzzles skip the short-term piles: ultra-short,
// a week, three months. (Until October 2026 the week was the last;
// items learned then come back once, a month after they were learned.) Every item that comes back, right or wrong,
// goes to the Ledger's record with how long it was away (ledger-log.js). Learning mode lets each game's dealer draw what's due into its next block, alongside
// new content. Deck is the tile that reviews everything due, across the games.
