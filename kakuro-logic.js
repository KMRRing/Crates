// Kakuro's human-style solver, pure: the steps a person takes, each found by a technique that says why, always the
// easiest step there is. It grades a grid (the hardest technique it needs), gives a hint (the next step, named, with
// its cells), and paces the computer player (kakuro-bot.js). A grid it can't finish is never dealt.
//
// Like a person's pencil marks, a cell's candidates come from its two runs: the digits some combination of each run
// still allows (its clue less the digits already in it, over its empty cells), less the digits already in either run.
// That much is taken as written (stateOf, and again after every digit placed); the steps are what follows from it:
//   rank 1  the last cell of a run (the rest of its clue); a cell whose two runs leave it one digit; a digit every
//           combination of a run holds, with one cell that can take it
//   rank 2  the ways that fit: a run's combinations narrowed to those its cells can hold, each digit placed where it
//           can go, a different digit each (pairs and triples in a run follow from it)
//   rank 3  a block's sums: inside a rectangle of the grid, the across clues of the runs it holds whole against its
//           down clues, which leaves the one or two cells only one of them covers (the rule of 45's cousin)
