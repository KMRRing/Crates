// Circuit played as a pair (docs/coop.md): how the game's saved run becomes a shared board and a shared board becomes
// a run again. Pure, so tests can check it without a page, and loaded by the host's phone on any page when a partner is
// let in (coop-games.js lists it), not only by Circuit's own.
//
// The shared board: the puzzle (`fixed`: it never changes) and one layer, `marks`, a character an edge as in a run
// ("0" nothing, "1" a line, "2" crossed). Hints are a tally (`hints`), the solve a once-value (`done`: { ms, score, by }).
// Undo, redo and the hint's gilt are each player's own and stay on their page.
