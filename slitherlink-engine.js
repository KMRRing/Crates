// Portolan's rules, puzzles and reasoning. One loop is drawn along the edges of a grid of dots; each number says how
// many of its cell's four sides the loop uses; the loop never crosses or touches itself. Every puzzle made here has
// exactly one answer and is graded by the hardest step a person needs to reach it. No page in it: slitherlink-worker.js
// makes puzzles off the page, slitherlink.js plays them, tests/slitherlink.mjs checks it all in Node.
//
// Edges are numbered row by row: the horizontal ones first (row 0 of dots, its C edges, then row 1…), then the vertical
// ones (cell row 0, its C+1 edges, …). A state is one number an edge: 0 unknown, 1 line, 2 crossed (known not to be
// part of the loop). The marks a player keeps are the same as characters, "0" "1" "2", one string a board.
//
// Shaded puzzles (November 2026) add a second kind of clue beside the numbers: a cell marked as inside the loop (clue
// code 5, "i" in a puzzle's grid) or outside it (6, "o"). Every cell is on one side of a loop, and a line is exactly
// where the sides change, so the shading and the edges known so far settle other edges (sides(), below). It is a rule of
// the shaded puzzles only: a plain puzzle never runs it, so plain puzzles are the puzzles they always were.
