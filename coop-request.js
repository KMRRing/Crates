// Joining a partner's board (docs/coop.md): the request, its answer, the party of two it opens, and leaving it. No page
// in it, so tests/coop-request.mjs plays it on the database in memory with several devices.
//
// You watch your partner's solo game (suite.js: watch) and press Request to join. That writes the request into the pair's
// room, crates/rooms/PAIR/join = { from: player id, device, name, game, at, answer?, by?, party?, playAt? }; their phone
// shows it wherever they are; Accept opens a party of two on their phone (the existing Party: crates/rooms/CODE/party, a
// table of two with the host and the guest seated, `coop` set) and the game's own request in it, carrying the host's board,
// then writes `party`, and both phones go to the game in that room. Every change of the request is a transaction on it
// (`step`), so only the first answer lands and nobody can part on it:
//
//   (asked) → accepting (a host device took it) → yes        (and the party is there before anyone is told yes)
//   (asked) → no (the host) | cancelled (the asker) | late (the asker's two minutes)
