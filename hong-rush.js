// Hong's puzzle rush: positions from the computer players' own hands where one discard (or one call) is clearly best,

// so it replays through the engine to exactly the table the player saw; the verdict comes from the coach's own
// reckoning at that table, the same as Why? in a game. Pure: the page, the tests and the generator share it.
