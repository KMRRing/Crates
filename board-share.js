// One board, two people editing it (docs/coop.md). No page in this file, so tests/board-share.mjs plays two editors
// against the database in memory.
//
// A shared board is what a game keeps in its room's branch (together.js, `board`):
//   { fixed: {…}, layers: { name: "one character a cell" }, tally?: { name: { id: 1 } }, once?: { name: value }, start?: {…}, rev }
//   fixed   what never changes while the board is shared (the puzzle); the game's own shape, JSON.
//   layers  the marks people make, one string a layer, a character a cell. Strings, since the database keeps no empty
//           list and reads a list back with holes; a string is whole or it is not there. Most classic boards are one layer
//           (Slitherlink's edges), some two (a cell's colour and its notes).
//   tally   counts that only grow (hints taken): a set of ids, so adding the same one twice counts once.
//   once    values the first writer sets and nobody changes (the time it was solved in).
//   rev     the number of edits applied: how an editor knows its own edit has come back to it.
//
// People change a board by edits, never by writing the board: a small list of operations applied inside the room's
// transaction on the board as it is then, so two edits at once to different cells both stand. An edit is a list of
//   { layer, i, from, to, weak? }   cell i of a layer was `from` where the editor made the change and is to be `to`
//   { add, id }                      the id added to a tally
//   { once, value }                  a value set if nobody has set it
// and the cell rule is `merge`, a three-way merge of one character: nobody else changed the cell, take the edit; the
// editor's change is already there, nothing to do; both changed it differently, the later edit wins (it is the one being
// applied) unless it is `weak`, an undo, which only puts back what it finds as it left it.
