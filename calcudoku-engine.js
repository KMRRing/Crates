// Calcudoku's rules and its grids, pure (no DOM), shared by the page, its worker (calcudoku-worker.js) and
// tests/calcudoku.mjs.
//
// The rules are the usual ones (the genre KenKen made famous): fill an n×n grid so that every row and every column
// holds each digit 1..n once; the grid is cut into cages, each with a target and an operation, and a cage's digits
// make its target by its operation (+ and × over any number of cells, − and ÷ over two, the larger first). A digit may
// repeat in a cage where its cells share no row or column. Hidden shows the targets alone; Products has every cage a
// product.
//
// How a grid is made (generate): a random Latin square first (calcudoku-solve.js fills an empty grid at random); then
// it's cut into cages grown from random cells to sizes drawn from the level's odds, and each cage is given a clue its
// digits make. The exact solver then counts solutions: wherever a second one appears, a cage where the two differ is
// given another clue that rules it out, or failing that is split in two, until there's one. Then the human-style
// solver (calcudoku-logic.js) grades it by the hardest technique it needs: a grid harder than its level is split where
// the solver first needed more (or got stuck), one easier has neighbouring cages joined while it keeps one solution,
// and one that still misses is thrown away for the next seed in the same stream, so a seed always makes the same grid.
