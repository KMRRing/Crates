// can ask the other to play a game together (ask), which shows a banner wherever the other is, and Play takes both of
// you into the duo match: the game opened in the room (?room=CODE&new=the request's time), at a new table, the solo
// game kept where it was. Nothing about multiplayer is set up inside a game.
