// Hong's computer players, and the coach that explains them. A player sees what a seat at the table sees (its own
// tiles, everything shown, the discards, the wall's count) and nothing else, and decides by value:
//  - routes: a hand has to reach the minimum fan, so it is read against the routes that get there (any hand, a half
//    or full flush in each suit, all pungs, thirteen orphans), each with its shanten (tiles from ready) and its live
//    tiles (the unseen copies that would bring it closer)
//  - chance: how likely each route is to win before the wall runs dry or someone else wins, worked out stage by stage
//    from its live tiles (a ready hand from its actual waits, each scored by the real rules), and what it would pay
//  - danger: each opponent's chance of being ready (by turn and calls, as measured in play), whether they can take a
//    discard at all (a hand that can't reach the minimum off one can't), the suit their calls point to, the tiles
//    passed since they drew (safe), and what dealing in costs beyond what their self-draw would cost anyway
//  - calls, kongs, wins and flowers decided the same way, and every decision explained for the learning mode.
// Rollouts were tried first: at four or five tiles from ready a few hundred playouts are mostly noise, and the bots
// that used them dawdled; this reckoning is exact for a ready hand and smooth everywhere else.
