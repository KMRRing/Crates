// Dandan on seats.js: a module of pure functions, so one runner moves it solo or at a table (README, Seats). Two
// seats; the computer takes the one nobody sits in. Whose decision it is: whoever holds priority, or is asked a question;
// conceding is anyone's at any time.
// A move made at the table is read for what it shows of the mover's hand (dandan-observe.js): every pass it led to at a
// moment that could show something, asked or not.
