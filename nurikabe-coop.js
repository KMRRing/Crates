// Atoll played as a pair (docs/coop.md): how the game's saved run becomes a shared board and a shared board becomes a run
// again. Pure, so tests can check it without a page, and loaded by the host's phone on any page when a partner is let in
// (coop-games.js lists it), not only by Atoll's own.
//
// The shared board: the puzzle (`fixed`: it never changes) and one layer, `marks`, a character a cell as in a run ("0" nothing,
// "1" sea, "2" an island dot: a note, but one both of you see). Hints are a tally (`hints`), the solve a once-value (`done`:
// { ms, score, by }). Undo, redo and the hint's gilt are each player's own and stay on their page.
