// Finding a game on the games screen (docs/the-games-screen.md): favourites, a search and a filter. No page in it, so

// ---------- favourites ----------
/** One key a game, `home:fav:<id>` = "1", under the games screen's own prefix: suite.js syncs every key but `suite:`'s, so
 *  the stars follow your solo code to every device. A key a game rather than one list, so that two devices starring
 *  different games merge (the newer key wins, key by key) where a list would lose one device's change; and an id of a game
 *  that has since gone is a key nothing reads. */

 *  screen: the sections in order, each in its own order), then each section without its starred games, which show once, in
 *  Favourites. A section with nothing left stays in the list, empty (the screen hides it); Favourites is left out while
 *  nothing is starred. A game's own section (`sec`) is still the one a filter by section means. */

/** Who can play a game, [fewest, most]: 1 is one person alone (against the computer, or a solo puzzle). Taken from what the game
