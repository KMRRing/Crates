// Masyu played as a pair (docs/coop.md): how the game's saved run becomes a shared board and a shared board becomes a run
// again. Pure, so tests can check it without a page, and loaded by the host's phone on any page when a partner is let in
// (coop-games.js lists it), not only by Masyu's own.
//
// The shared board: the puzzle (`fixed`: it never changes) and one layer, `marks`, a character an edge as in a run ("0" nothing,
// "1" a line, "2" crossed). Hints are a tally (`hints`), the solve a once-value (`done`: { ms, score, by }). Undo, redo and the
// hint's gilt are each player's own and stay on their page.
