// it takes over when the app goes off screen, and the page reloads onto it when it comes back. Taking over in the
// middle of a game could mix old code with new.

// Update (the games screen's button) and reloadFresh (another device is already on a newer version) don't wait for
// that: they compare this device's version with the site's and, when they differ, have the service worker fetch only
// the files that changed (tools/service-worker.js), saying at every stage how far it has got. No wait lasts for ever:
// one that runs out falls back to the full refresh (the stored copy emptied and fetched afresh), and nothing is
// emptied unless the site has just answered.
