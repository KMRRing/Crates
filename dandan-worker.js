// Dandan's look-ahead off the page's thread (dandan-think.js): the computer's moves at Hard, so the table never stops
// while it thinks, and the coach's weighing of your decisions. A request is { id, kind, state, seat, move }: "move",
// the computer's move; "think", the coach's weighing of a decision (its Hint, and Always); "check", the same with a
// move of yours kept in to the end, so it's set against the coach's deal by deal. Each stops at so many deals, not at
// a time, so a position gets the same answer on any phone (the time is only a backstop for a slow one).
