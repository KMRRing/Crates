// Sudoku's rules and its grids, pure (no DOM), shared by the page, its worker (sudoku-worker.js) and tests/sudoku.mjs.
//
// The rules are the usual ones: fill the grid so that every row, every column and every region holds each digit once.
// The regions are the boxes (3×3 on a 9×9, two rows by three columns on a 6×6) or, in Jigsaw, pieces of any shape;
// Diagonals adds the two long diagonals as units of their own; in Killer there are no digits to start with, only
// cages, each with the sum of its cells, and no digit repeats within a cage.
//
// How a grid is made (generate): a random solution first (sudoku-solve.js fills an empty grid at random); then, for
// the digit puzzles, its digits are taken away a pair at a time, each pair the mirror of the other through the centre,
// for as long as the solver still finds exactly one solution; for Killer, the solution is cut into cages of one cell
// each and neighbouring cages are joined while it still has one. Then the human-style solver (sudoku-logic.js)
// grades it by the hardest technique it needs. A grid harder than the level gets digits back (or cages split), in the
// reverse of the order they went, until it's down to the level; a grid easier than the level is thrown away and
// another made from the next seed in the same stream, so a seed always makes the same grid, on every phone.
