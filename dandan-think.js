// (the ones Medium, dandan-policy.js, would weigh, and passing) and plays each out to the start of the turn after next
// in many deals of the cards the seat can't see. Below each move the decisions that follow are searched for both
// players (the tree: each picks what has done best for it there, over the deals), and where each line lands is judged by
// dandan-eval.js's chance of winning, which is the rest of the game as these players would play it; the move with the
// best average is played. The deals are the same for every move (and so is the rest of the game's luck), so the moves
// are set against each other on the same footing, and a move clearly behind the best stops being played out early (a
// race). Pure functions; the coach runs them in dandan-worker.js.
//
// A deal (determinize) keeps everything the seat knows where it is: its hand, the table, the graveyard and exile, the
// stack, the library cards it has seen, the cards it knows are in the other hand; the rest of the other hand and of
// the library are the remaining cards in a random order, the other hand weighed by what their play has shown (the hand
// they kept, and every pass they made where a card would clearly have been played: dandan-reads.js, dandan-observe.js).
// What the other player knew of the library stays with the places they knew, whatever card is there now.
