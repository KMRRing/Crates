// Deck on the games screen (README, Deck, "Scope"): its plate in the banner beside Random's. Deck starts a review of
// what's due, across the games, in one tap (deck.html#review); the banner's Choose button (banner.js) opens the sheet
// where games and topics are left in or out, which Deck's own page opens too. The rules are deck-scope.js's; the choice is kept on this device
// (suite:deck, the games and topics taken out; suite: keys don't sync). Deck's own page asks the same scope for its
// review, so what the line counts is what the review deals.
//
// A topic is a subject of the knowledge base, whose index (kb-index.js, 118 KB) every page would otherwise carry just
// for this line: it's fetched only when a topic is out, or when the sheet lists them.
