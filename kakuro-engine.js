// The rules are the usual ones: a crossword of numbers. Every run of white cells, across or down, holds different
// digits 1 to 9 that add up to the clue at its head (the black cell to its left, or above it); in Products they
// multiply to it.
//
// How a grid is made (generate): a pattern of black cells, symmetric under a half turn, with no run shorter than two;
// a fill, a digit in every white cell and none twice in a run, never two crossing pairs that could be swapped; the
// fill leaned toward clues with fewer ways or more (the level's doubt); its clues worked out from it; then, while the
// exact solver (kakuro-solve.js) finds two solutions, a digit where they differ is changed, until it finds exactly one.
// The human-style solver (kakuro-logic.js) grades it; a grid not at its level leans the next try's fill the other
// way. Every number in it comes from the seed by integer arithmetic, so a seed makes the same grid on every phone.

 * shown to both, until the relay below finishes: each player works out what they can from what they see, what they
 * find goes to the other, and round again. The clues shown are the ones worth most: those whose cells the other
 * player already sees the crossing clues of, so they'd hold both sums there. As few are shared as that takes (about a
 * third), so each still holds a dozen or so clues the other needs. A table of three to six gets the clues dealt round
 * it a clue cell at a time instead (across and down from one clue cell to the same player), and the same relay.
 *
 * A split is a string, a character a run (in the shape's order): the player ("0".."5") who alone sees that clue, or
 * "*" for a clue everyone sees.
