// schwarz and every point together, exactly, and takes seconds on a whole hand; this one counts points alone (the 61
// and Schneider are points) by alpha-beta over the cards as bits, keeping what it learns of each position at a trick's
// start, and trying once each run of cards that can't differ (two Obers side by side in one hand, the 8 and 9 below
// them). Schwarz, which is tricks and not points, it looks for on its own when a side is about to take nothing.
// The computer players (trumps-bot.js) and the coach play by it: each deal of the cards they can't see solved after
// each card they may play.
